        "Mumbai: Healthcare and Information Technology (IT) stocks witnessed the highest foreign outflows in the second half of September as foreign investors dumped shares worth ₹4,521 crore and ₹4,036 crore, respectively, according to NSDL data. The selling came amid heightened uncertainty over Donald Trump's proposed H-1B visa restrictions - a major source of worry for the domestic IT industry - and new pharma tariff measures, weighing down sentiment in both these sectors.\"Export-oriented sectors like healthcare and IT saw outflows as President Trump imposed tariffs on pharma companies, which initially pertained to the branded segment, but the fear of further unbridled tariffs continues to fuel investor nervousness,\" said U R Bhat, co-founder & director, Alphaniti. \"IT sector is under a cloud due to the revised H-1B visa norms.\"The healthcare sector saw selling worth ₹1,601 crore in the first half of September after outflows worth ₹1,417 crore in August.Between January and August, foreign investors withdrew shares worth ₹10,964 crore from the healthcare sector. The sell-off was sharper in IT stocks as they divested shares worth ₹61,786 crore in the sector in the same period.\"The recent US decision to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas has spooked investors, who have been awaiting clarity on demand recovery and policy stability before rebuilding positions,\" said Sudeep Shah, head of technical and derivatives, SBI Securities. \"While the pace of selling has moderated, the Nifty IT index still trades below key short- and long-term moving averages.\" 124401926Shah said the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) zone of 34,840-34,850 is expected to act as immediate resistance. The Nifty IT index closed at 35,232 on Friday.Overall, FPIs sold shares worth ₹19,647 crore across 15 sectors during the period, compared with ₹16,737 crore in the first half.Despite the cuts in the GST rates, overseas investors offloaded shares worth over ₹3,000 crore in the consumer durables and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sectors in the second half of September.FOREIGN INVESTOR PURCHASES Global investors bought shares worth Rs 1,733 crore in the automobile sector in the second half of the month, after purchasing Rs 1,908 crore in the first half of the month. The sector witnessed inflows worth Rs 1,803 crore in August, as the sector stands to benefit the most due to revised GST rates. Bhat said auto companies stand to benefit the most from the fall in GST levied on them, along with most auto ancillaries as they can pass the costs easily. Overseas investors purchased shares worth Rs 5,523 crore across eight sectors in the second half of September"

        "India Inc more than doubled its average flex seat requests — to 53 this year from 25 in 2023 — reflecting a 46% increase compounded annually over the two-year period, according to myHQ, a commercial real estate transactions platform backed by property consultancy Anarock.Startups, meanwhile, are prioritising leaner, cost-efficient setups, with average seat sizes more than halving to 10 from 22 in the same period, reflecting a shift toward agility and smarter resource allocation.“India is at the forefront of the flex movement worldwide, setting new benchmarks for scale, innovation, and now institutional investment as well,” said Anuj Puri, group chairman, Anarock. “With five operators already publicly listed and more preparing to enter the market, flex is experiencing an unprecedented wave of investment that is transforming commercial real estate.” The sector now includes over 1,500 unique brands, with more than 50 operators running ten or more centres. By 2030, India's commercial real estate market is projected to reach $120 billion with flex spaces alone touching $10 billion.“Startups were the pioneers that made flexible workspaces aspirational in India; however, today enterprises are cementing their indispensability,” said Utkarsh Kawatra, co-founder and CEO, myHQ. “Flexible solutions currently account for 20% of all office transactions, and by 2030, their market penetration is set to reach around 30% — meaning one in three offices will operate within a flex space.”Commercial real estate absorption trends show that the IT/ITeS sector contributes 25–30% of overall leasing demand. When focusing exclusively on end-user demand by excluding absorption from flexible workspace operators, the IT/ITeS sector's share rises to around 35%.However, in the flexible workspace segment, IT/ITeS clients represent more than 40% of total demand — about 15% higher than their share in traditional commercial leasing. This robust presence reflects the expanding role of flexible workspaces as a preferred choice for the IT/ITeS sector.India's global capability centre (GCC) base is projected to reach 2,400–2,550 by 2030, with a $110 billion market size. Mid-market GCCs are expanding at a 6.2% compounded annually versus 4.5% overall, adding 120 new centres and 40,000 jobs by 2026, while state policies in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka are driving additional expansion and potential flex demand.Between 2023 and 2025, the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector’s office space requirement has expanded significantly with flex demand more than doubling to 10% from 4.5%."

While all the deaths have been linked to Coldrif, regulators in the world's third-largest medicine-producing country have asked consumers to also avoid Respifresh TR and ReLife. None of the syrups have been exported. However, the World Health Organization warned of potential risks through unregulated channels. Here are details of the three tainted cough syrups: COLDRIF * Linked to all the deaths of the children who came from the central state of Madhya Pradesh. They died of kidney failure, mostly in a government hospital in another state. * Made by Sresan Pharmaceutical Manufacturer, based in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. * Contaminated with 48.6% of toxin diethylene glycol (DEG); the permissible limit by India and the WHO is 0.1%. * Made in May 2025 and was set to expire in April 2027. * The syrup has been banned and the owner of the company arrested. The owner and the company have not answered repeated calls from Reuters. RESPIFRESH TR * Not linked to any deaths. * Made by Rednex Pharmaceuticals, based in the western state of Gujarat. * Contaminated with 1.342% DEG. * Made in January 2025 and was set to expire in December 2026. * Syrup recalled and the company ordered to stop production of all medical products. Company officials did not respond to calls from Reuters. RELIFE * Not linked to any deaths. * Made by Shape Pharma, based in Gujarat, in January 2025 and was set to expire in December 2026. * Contaminated with 0.616% DEG. * Syrup recalled and the company ordered to stop production of all medical products.
